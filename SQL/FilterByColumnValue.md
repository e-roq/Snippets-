# SQL Snippet

To select rows from a table where the value in a column named status equals 'referred', you can use the SQL SELECT statement combined with the WHERE clause. The WHERE clause is used to filter records based on specified conditions

```SQL
SELECT *
    FROM table_name
    WHERE status = 'referred';
```
